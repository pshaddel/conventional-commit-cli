Using [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one of the best way we can organize our commits so we can find out what happend in that commit. This is a minimal cli tool that will help you commit using this convention.
After implementing this cli I found out that commitizen has a realy similar cli but it needs a commitizen config file. So I think I keep developing this tool till I'll be happy with it.

It is working on MacOS right now and I will add Linux file as soon as possible

### Installation
Run this command:
```bash
brew install  pshaddel/conventionalcommit/conventionalcommit
```
